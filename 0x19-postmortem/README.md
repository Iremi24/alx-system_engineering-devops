# Postmortem for the Great Database Meltdown of 2024

## Issue Summary
Imagine you're peacefully sipping your coffee when suddenly, your database decides to take a coffee break too—except it forgot to come back. That’s exactly what happened on August 15, 2024...

- Outage Duration: August 15, 2024, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM (UTC)
- Impact: 70% of users were unable to access the website, resulting in a significant drop in transaction volume during the outage period.
- Root Cause: Unoptimized database queries caused the database to become overloaded during a traffic spike, leading to increased response times and eventual failure.

## Timeline
- 10:00 AM: Monitoring alert detected high response times.
- 10:05 AM: Engineers began investigating database performance.
- 10:20 AM: Initially suspected network latency as the cause, but this was a misleading path.
- 10:30 AM: Issue escalated to the database team for further analysis.
- 10:50 AM: Database team identified unoptimized queries and began implementing optimizations.
- 11:00 AM: Optimizations completed; monitoring confirmed that response times returned to normal, and the outage was resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- Root Cause: The root cause was unoptimized SQL queries that were not tested under high-load conditions. When traffic spiked, these queries caused the database to become overwhelmed, leading to slow response times and eventual service failure.
- Resolution: The engineering team applied optimizations to the SQL queries, including indexing frequently accessed columns and implementing caching for repetitive queries. This significantly reduced the load on the database, and normal operations were restored.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- Improvements: 
  - Regularly test SQL queries under simulated high-load conditions.
  - Enhance database performance monitoring to detect and alert on query performance issues before they cause an outage.
- Task List:
  - [ ] Implement automated load testing for SQL queries.
  - [ ] Improve monitoring of database query performance.
  - [ ] Apply query optimizations and indexing to other potential bottlenecks.
  - [ ] Conduct a code review to identify other areas where caching can be implemented.
